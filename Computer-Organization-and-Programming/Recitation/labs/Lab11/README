CS2110                         Lab #11                     Fall 2018
======================================================================

(This lab is collaborative, so feel free to work with friends or TAs.)

Objective: To get comfortable with our Linux environment, and to
           practice using the basic assembly instructions (such as
           LEA, LD, LDR, LDI, ST, STR, STI, AND, ADD, BR).

You can find an appendix of basic assembly instructions on Canvas under:
   Files > Assembly Resources > PattPatelAppA.pdf

Focus on the program design process:
   1) Start with Pseudo-code
   2) Decide on a register-usage scheme
   3) Translate your psuedo-code into assembly one block at a time
   4) Test each block
   5) Debug
   6) Repeat steps 3-5 until your entire program is complete

Your Assignment:
================

We have provided you with two skeleton assembly file called "sumtorial.asm" and "sum.asm".

Edit this file and turn in the following:

    1) First you will write an assembly program that add:s two numbers and prints
    out the result. See more details in the sum.asm file.
    To Test:
	a) load the sum.asm file in complx
	b) hit run
	c) You should see your output (The sum is: 5) in the I/O box. Show this output to your TA's to recieve a check off

    2) Write an assembly program called "sumtorial.asm" that calculates the sumtorial of a given number.

      The "sumtorial" of a given number is very like the factorial of that number
      except that instead of multiplying you will add.
      Factorial(n) = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 2 * 1
      Sumtorial(n) = n + (n-1) + (n-2) + (n-3) + ... + 2 + 1
      To Test:
	a) load the sumtorial.asm file in complx
	b) hit run
        c) You should see your output (15) in the I/O box. Show this output to your TA's to recieve the check off
